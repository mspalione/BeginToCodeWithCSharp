The Begin To Code With CSharp written by Rob S. Miles is a beginner series book going over C# fundamentals. 
I chose to go through this book as I took a position at a company that uses C# and it had been several months since I had written any C# code.
I found the review of base principles as an adequate refresher, but as I was not a true beginner, I was able to do a bit more with the program.
I created methods to manipulate the program further. I dug down into the dictionary and added methods to be called in the program.

To see the program work, you must download the solution on your machine and then run my code. Or play around with it yourself!

You can see where I added to the Snaps dictionary on ch. 8 or here: https://github.com/mspalione/BeginToCodeWithCSharp/blob/master/BeginToCodeWithCSharp/Chapters/Chapter%2008/Ch08_08_TinyContactBookLocalStore.cs
